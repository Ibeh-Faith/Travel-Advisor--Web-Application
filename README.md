# Travel-Advisor--Web-Application
Used Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.), SQL Server, Java and XHTML, to complete a Web application that has similar functions as the famous website www.tripadvisor.com. In this Project, I only implemented the website's things to do feature and some other features.
